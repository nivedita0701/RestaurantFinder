## State Management

This application uses React's **useState** and **useEffect** hooks to manage local state for:
- User input in forms (e.g., restaurant registration, filters).
- Dynamic data (e.g., restaurants, categories, reviews).

State for more complex features is organized using component-specific state logic. For larger-scale state requirements, integrating a global state management tool like Redux or Context API can be considered for scalability.
